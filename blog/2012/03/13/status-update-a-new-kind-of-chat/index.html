<p>Chat has always been central to Neflaria. It&#8217;s what allows everyone to form
clans, run auctions, and make lifelong friends (and sometimes enemies). It’s the
meeting ground for the great community we have built together.</p>

<p>However, it’s also one of the most neglected areas of our application
development; we&#8217;re still running on much the same technology that existed in 2001.
In the last four years, the only significant updates came with
Shattered Tranquility’s quest messages, and the name colors that came with the
credit update.</p>

<p>Our vision is much larger.</p>

<p>We have finished testing out the technology that will allow us to take the chat
system further than ever. Imagine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Real-time chat: No more waiting for chat to refresh!</li>
<li>Custom chat rooms: Have your own room for friends and alliances, and invite multiple friends to
private conversations!</li>
<li>Connect to chat externally: Use a chat client such as
Pidgin to take part in in-game conversations when you can&#8217;t be in the game!</li>
<li>All HTML: Just like the current chat, you won&#8217;t need any special plugins, just a
web browser!</li>
</ul>


<p>We&#8217;ve finished our proof of concept and we&#8217;re even using it internally within
Olivine Labs to communicate between developers. We plan to open it up to
game staff as we make further progress.</p>

<p>Additionally, we now have a deadline! Our goal is a <strong>June 30</strong> release and this
release will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand-new website!</li>
<li>Updated interface!</li>
<li>New chat system!</li>
<li>The implementation of a new item and equip slot: the Talisman!</li>
</ul>


<p>In the next post we are going to discuss what exactly a Talisman is and what amazing things it means for Neflaria!</p>
