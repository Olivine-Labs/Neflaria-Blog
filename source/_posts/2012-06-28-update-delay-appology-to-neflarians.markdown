Dear Neflarians,

We regret to inform you that due to unforeseen circumstances, our promised Talisman update will be delayed a few weeks. Two weeks ago we were on pace for an early finish to the update and we had planned to have beta testers for talisman by this week. However both me (Jack) and Drew were bogged down by our day job. And since we are the main programmers, the update has been stalled. It was a hellish 2 weeks for us which consisted of 12 hours/day work, even into the weekends. This week we both are having to move into a new living place so it will be hectic at best. We will continue to push the development of the update as soon as possible.

We’d also like to announce the coming reset date to take place on the 30th of July.

Confirmed list of update features:
_ Talisman
_ Interface (frontpage, char creation and in-game interface/chat)
_ A jukebox feature for music tracks in nef.
